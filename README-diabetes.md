In the project, the dataset diabetic.csv contained information about diabetic patients, including their demographics, medical history, treatments received, and whether they were readmitted to the hospital.

For the predictive model, I used features such as age, gender, medical history, medications, and lab test results to predict the likelihood of readmission. This model aimed to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and intervene early to prevent readmissions.

For the K-Means clustering approach, I used features related to readmission likelihood, such as previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, and medication adherence. By clustering patients based on these features, I identified distinct groups of patients with different risk profiles and proposed tailored interventions.
